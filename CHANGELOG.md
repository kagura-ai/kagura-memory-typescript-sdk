## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **`SecretClient` — the zero-knowledge secret store**
  ([#28](https://github.com/kagura-ai/kagura-memory-typescript-sdk/issues/28)):
  the fourth REST client, and the only member of the
  Files/Resource/Workspace/Secret set that was never ported. The comment on
  `KaguraRestClient` had been naming it as a sibling since 0.1.0 while
  nothing implemented it.

  Full surface: the pubkey registry (`registerPubkey`, `listPubkeys`,
  `listMyPubkeys`, `approvePubkey`, `revokePubkey`), secrets (`putSecret`,
  `putSecretForRecipients`, `listSecrets`, `fetchSecret`, `revokeGrant`,
  `deleteSecret`), and `verifyAudit`. `putSecretForRecipients` enforces the
  server's grant-consistency invariant client-side — every recipient must be
  `active` and must carry a fingerprint matching its own pubkey — and derives
  `recipients_snapshot` and `grant_pubkey_ids` from one list so they agree by
  construction instead of by the caller's care. 403 is mapped to a message
  naming all three of its causes, because the server answers 403 rather than
  404 precisely so the response cannot confirm a secret exists.

- **age crypto behind an optional peer dependency**: `generateKeypair`,
  `recipientFromIdentity`, `fingerprint`, `armorEncode`/`armorDecode`,
  `encrypt`, `decrypt`. Crypto is delegated to
  [`age-encryption`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/age-encryption) (typage,
  by age's author — the counterpart of the `pyrage` binding Python uses),
  declared as an **optional** peer dependency and imported lazily. A plain
  `npm install kagura-memory` still installs nothing; zero runtime
  dependencies stays true, matching how Python gates the same code behind its
  `[secret]` extra. Calling a crypto function without the package raises
  `KaguraCryptoError` naming the install command.

  Interoperability with the Python SDK is verified, not assumed: checked-in
  vectors prove this SDK decrypts pyrage-written ciphertext (grease stanza
  included), derives the same recipient from an identity, computes the same
  fingerprint, and armors byte-identically.

  One divergence was necessary. Recipients are X25519-only in both SDKs, but
  Python gets that from `pyrage.x25519.Recipient.from_str` rejecting anything
  else one line after its regex, while `age-encryption`'s `addRecipient`
  *accepts* `age1pq1…` and `age1tag1…`. Copying Python's regex would have let
  a TypeScript caller write ciphertext the Python CLI could never open, so
  `RECIPIENT_RE` is tightened to bech32's alphabet — which excludes `1`, and
  every non-X25519 form carries a second `1`.

- **`KeyManager` and the `KeyStore` interface** for age private-key custody,
  keyed as `identity:{profile}` exactly as Python keys it, so a shared
  backend interoperates. No default backend ships: Node has no stdlib
  keychain and every option is a native module, so a default would mean
  either a native runtime dependency or the plaintext file Python explicitly
  refuses. Requiring a store keeps custody fail-closed with no insecure
  fallback to reach by accident.

- **`KaguraClient.callRawTool(name, args)`** — call any MCP tool by name.
  `callTool` is private, so before this a tool with no typed wrapper was
  unreachable: `secret_*` was exactly that, and the only workarounds were
  vendoring a patched SDK or hand-rolling JSON-RPC. Typed wrappers remain the
  surface to prefer; this makes the next gap a detour rather than a dead end.

- `KaguraSecretError`, `KaguraCryptoError`, `KaguraKeyCustodyError` — the
  same three-level hierarchy as Python's, so a contract violation is
  catchable separately from a transport failure.

- CI now asserts both halves of "optional": that a bare install of the packed
  tarball has no `age-encryption` and still gives an actionable error, and
  that the crypto round-trips from **both** the ESM and CJS builds once it is
  installed. The CJS half matters because `age-encryption` is ESM-only and
  reached through a native dynamic `import()`; a bundler change that rewrote
  it to `require()` would fail only in the published artifact.

  `npm run test:no-webcrypto` runs the whole suite with `globalThis.crypto`
  deleted — Node 18's world, where WebCrypto is not yet a global. That
  condition broke encryption and keygen while leaving decryption working, an
  asymmetry only one leg of the CI matrix could see; it now reproduces on any
  Node version, locally and in `prepublishOnly`. The SDK installs
  `node:crypto`'s `webcrypto` itself when nothing is there, so
  `engines.node >= 18` stays honest.

### Security

- **A malformed age identity no longer leaks the private key into error
  messages.** `@scure/base`, under `age-encryption`, puts the entire
  offending string in its bech32 errors (`Invalid checksum in
  AGE-SECRET-KEY-1…: expected "…"`). Both `decrypt()` and
  `recipientFromIdentity()` interpolated that into their message and attached
  it as `cause`, which Node prints whenever an error is logged — so a
  single-character typo in a stored identity wrote a reconstructable private
  key to logs, CI output, and any crash reporter. Now a fixed message with no
  interpolation and no cause chain.

  TypeScript-only: `pyrage` answers `invalid Bech32 encoding` and echoes
  nothing, so the Python port is unaffected.

- **`deleteSecret` rejects names that would retarget the request.** `.` and
  `..` are RFC 3986 *unreserved*, so percent-encoding leaves them intact and
  the URL parser then resolves them away:
  `deleteSecret("cloudflare/../openai")` issued
  `DELETE /api/v1/config/secrets/openai`, and `deleteSecret("..")` issued
  `DELETE /api/v1/config/`. On a destructive owner-only operation that is
  worth refusing outright — an empty, `.`, or `..` segment now throws
  `KaguraSecretError` before any request. Dots *inside* a segment
  (`cloudflare/api.token`, `a..b`) are still fine.

  The Python SDK has the same hole (`quote(".", safe="") === "."`) and wants
  the same guard.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-07-28

### Added

- **`RecallOptions.includeSuperseded`**
  ([#25](https://github.com/kagura-ai/kagura-memory-typescript-sdk/issues/25)):
  `remember({ supersedes })` shipped in 0.5.0 without its read side. The
  whole argument for a supersede edge over `forget()` + `remember()` is
  that history survives — but nothing could ask for it back, so it was
  reachable only by a caller who had kept the old `memoryId`, which is the
  bookkeeping the edge exists to remove. `RememberOptions.supersedes` even
  documented `recall({ includeSuperseded: true })`, an option that did not
  exist; `recall()` builds its arguments from an allowlist, so not even a
  cast got through. Same flag name as the Python SDK's `include_superseded`.

  A guard test now resolves every `` `method({ option })` `` promised in a
  `src/client.ts` doc comment against the option interface that method
  actually takes, so the next such promise fails the build instead of a
  release.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-28

> Supersedes 0.4.0, which reached `main` but was never tagged or published
> to npm. Everything that would have been 0.4.0 ships here, so the jump
> from 0.3.0 is a single release.

### Fixed

- **Refreshing a profile with no refresh token no longer round-trips**
  ([#14](https://github.com/kagura-ai/kagura-memory-typescript-sdk/issues/14)):
  such a profile cannot be refreshed, but the SDK went to the network
  anyway and surfaced the server's `invalid_grant` as "refresh token is no
  longer valid" — describing a token that never existed. Now raises
  `KaguraAuthExpiredError` before the request, naming the real cause.
  Fixed in lockstep with the Python SDK, which shares this credentials
  file and had the same defect (python-sdk#249).

### Added

- **`npx kagura-memory auth …` — an `auth`-only CLI**
  ([#17](https://github.com/kagura-ai/kagura-memory-typescript-sdk/issues/17)):
  `login`, `refresh`, `status`, `use`, `logout`, with the same flag names
  as the Python CLI's `kagura auth …` and writing the same
  `~/.kagura/credentials.json`. A TypeScript-only team no longer needs a
  Python install just to authenticate a machine.

  Scope is deliberately `auth` only — memory operations stay library-only.
  The credentials file is the artifact both SDKs share, so converging
  there is the point; duplicating the rest of the CLI surface would only
  multiply parity drift.

  Zero runtime dependencies is preserved: argv parsing is hand-rolled, and
  the browser launch shells out to the platform opener. The device code
  and URL are printed unconditionally *before* any launch attempt, so a
  silent or failed browser never leaves the user stuck. `--no-browser`
  suppresses the launch; a non-interactive stdin declines destructive
  prompts rather than hanging, with `--yes` as the explicit opt-in.

- **`refresh()` — explicit profile refresh**
  ([#16](https://github.com/kagura-ai/kagura-memory-typescript-sdk/issues/16)):
  clients already auto-refresh near expiry, but nothing reachable could
  force a rotation, change scope, or refresh ahead of a long batch.
  `refreshAccessToken` (exported in 0.4.0) is the stateless RFC call and
  writes nothing, and `KaguraOAuth` — which refreshes *and* persists under
  the cross-process lock — was not exported at all. Same shape of gap as
  the login surface in 0.4.0.

  Scope narrowing goes through the refresh grant silently; widening is
  rejected by the server, so `refresh()` falls back to a full device flow
  for consent, matching the Python CLI's `kagura auth refresh --scope`.
  Diverging there would make scope changes behave differently between the
  two SDKs on the credentials file they share.

  Also exports `KaguraOAuth`, `withRefreshed`, `REFRESH_SKEW_SEC`, and the
  `SharedCredentialsState` type.

- **Interactive OAuth login**
  ([#9](https://github.com/kagura-ai/kagura-memory-typescript-sdk/issues/9)):
  `login()` runs the RFC 8628 Device Authorization Grant end to end
  (authorize → hand the user code to the host app via `onUserCode` →
  poll → persist) and writes `~/.kagura/credentials.json` in exactly the
  format the Python CLI writes, so profiles stay interchangeable. A
  TypeScript-only consumer no longer needs the Python CLI to obtain
  credentials. No terminal IO and no browser launching inside the SDK.
  Nothing is written unless the exchange succeeds, so a failed login never
  disturbs an existing profile.

  Behaviour is aligned with `kagura auth login`, since both SDKs read and
  write the same file: scope defaults to `DEFAULT_SCOPE`
  (`"memory:read memory:write"`) with `READ_ONLY_SCOPE` as the opt-down,
  the new profile does not steal an existing default, and a response with
  no `refresh_token` warns and still persists rather than failing — the
  Python CLI models a non-refreshable profile as a valid degraded state.

  The underlying primitives — `authorizeDevice`, `pollForToken`,
  `refreshAccessToken`, `revokeToken`, `DEFAULT_CLIENT_ID`, the grant-type
  constants — and the credentials store (`loadCredentialsFile`,
  `saveCredentialsFile`, `updateProfile`, `setProfile`, `getProfile`,
  `removeProfile`, `deleteProfile`, `setDefaultProfile`,
  `deleteCredentialsFile`, `defaultCredentialsPath`,
  `emptyCredentialsFile`, `isExpired`) are now exported as well. They
  existed since 0.1.0 but were unreachable — `src/index.ts` re-exported
  neither module.

- **`KaguraClient.recallNearby()`** — the WHERE axis
  ([#5](https://github.com/kagura-ai/kagura-memory-typescript-sdk/issues/5),
  server origin memory-cloud#1331): a deterministic spatial query over
  `details.location`, nearest first with `distance_m`, mirroring
  `recallUpcoming`. Args `contextId, lat, lon, radiusM = 1000, k = 20`.
  Out-of-range or non-finite coordinates throw locally rather than
  round-tripping to an HTTP 422. Returns a typed `RecallNearbyResponse`
  (following `listTags`, not `recallUpcoming`'s bare `ToolResult`, so
  `distance_m` is reachable without a cast). New model types
  `MemoryLocation`, `NearbyMemory`, `RecallNearbyResponse`.

- **`RememberOptions.supersedes`**
  ([#7](https://github.com/kagura-ai/kagura-memory-typescript-sdk/issues/7)):
  declare a memory as the newer version of an existing one. The old
  memory is shadowed out of default recall but stays restorable and
  reachable via `recall({ includeSuperseded: true })` and `explore()` —
  unlike `forget()` + `remember()`, which destroys the history.

- **`UpdateMemoryOptions.details`**
  ([#6](https://github.com/kagura-ai/kagura-memory-typescript-sdk/issues/6)):
  `details` could previously only be written by `remember()`, which left
  the `externalId` upsert path unable to carry it. Note the server
  replaces `details` wholesale — round-trip keys you want to keep.

- **`ListTagsOptions.withTags`**
  ([#8](https://github.com/kagura-ai/kagura-memory-typescript-sdk/issues/8),
  server origin memory-cloud#830): multi-tag AND drill-down mapped to the
  `with_tags` parameter, for server-side faceted browsing. An empty array
  is a no-op filter and is not sent.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-16

### Removed

- **Breaking:** the v0.36-era `KaguraAgent` session-analysis model types
  (`Message`, `Artifact`, `Session`, `MemoryInfo`, `Memory`, `LLMUsage`,
  `MemoryToStore`, `RecallQuery`, `AnalysisResult`, `ExploredMemory`,
  `ProcessResult`). The Python SDK removed the actor and its models in
  v0.37.0 (python-sdk#233 — the actor role lives in the
  [kagura-agent](https://pypi.org/project/kagura-agent/) package); this
  SDK never ported the actor, so the types were dead exports with no
  consumers.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-16

### Added

- **Agent control plane** (RFC-0002 P0, memory-cloud **v0.49.0+**;
  [#1](https://github.com/kagura-ai/kagura-memory-typescript-sdk/issues/1)/
  [#2](https://github.com/kagura-ai/kagura-memory-typescript-sdk/issues/2)/
  [#3](https://github.com/kagura-ai/kagura-memory-typescript-sdk/issues/3)):
  - Agent Registry wrappers on `KaguraClient` — `registerAgent`,
    `listAgents`, `getAgent`, `updateAgent` (with the `status`
    kill-switch and `enforcementMode` ramp), `deleteAgent`
    (owner/admin-gated; delete cascades agent-bound API keys).
  - Subtractive context bindings — `bindAgentContext`,
    `listAgentBindings`, `updateAgentBinding`, `unbindAgentContext`
    (`canRead` / `writePolicy` `deny|direct` / `isDefault`;
    `allowedMemoryTypes`/`allowedSourceTypes` reserved for
    memory-cloud#1286).
  - `KaguraClient.getAgentBootstrap()` — one session-start call composing
    context guide + pinned + trusted-only recall + upcoming time memories
    + agent state, fail-soft per component with a `degraded` flag.
  - `AgentsClient` — REST bootstrap fallback
    (`POST /api/v1/agents/{agent_id}/bootstrap`) for API-key-only callers
    such as agent-bound member keys.
  - `Agent`, `AgentBinding`, and `AgentBootstrap*` wire models;
    `agent_not_found`/`binding_not_found` now map to
    `KaguraNotFoundError`. `MIN_SERVER_VERSION` stays 0.17.1 — only this
    surface needs the newer server.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-05

Initial release — a TypeScript port of the
[Python SDK](https://github.com/kagura-ai/kagura-memory-python-sdk) core.

### Added

- `KaguraClient` — MCP (JSON-RPC) memory operations: remember, recall,
  explore, reference, forget, and REST GETs.
- `ResourceClient` — REST ingestion of external events (resource tokens).
- `FilesClient` — R2 file uploads with sha256 integrity binding.
- `WorkspaceClient` — workspace members, invitations, and API key management.
- Auth resolution mirroring the Python SDK: explicit `apiKey` >
  `KAGURA_API_KEY` > OAuth profile (`~/.kagura/credentials.json`, shared with
  the Python CLI, with auto-refresh) > `.kagura.json`.
- Typed error hierarchy under `KaguraError` (auth, not-found, rate-limit,
  quota, connection).
- Dual ESM + CJS builds with bundled `.d.ts`; zero runtime dependencies;
  Node.js >= 18.
